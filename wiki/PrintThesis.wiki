#summary Printing your thesis.

== Printing result is not as expected, looks smaller ==

General mistake: <br>
Printing thesis directly from pdf preview.<br><br>

Why:<br>
The printview pdf is not for printing, only for viewing purpose. <br><br>

== How to print ==

=== a. Create pdf file: File > Export > PDF (pdflatex)===

=== b. Open your the created pdf using your pdf reader software ===
<br>

=== c. Setting the printer option ===
Make sure you have the following settings:
 * Paper type : *A4* (The paper used for the thesis is A4, sometimes the default is letter)
 * Page Scaling : *None* (It is a common mistake to select "Fit to printable area", or "Shrink to printable area", or similar. Leave it at "None".)
